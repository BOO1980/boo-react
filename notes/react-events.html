<h1>React Events</h1>
<ul><li>Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events</li>
<li>React has the same events as HTML: Click, change, mouseover</li></ul>
<h2>Adding Events</h2>
<ul><li>React events are written in camelCase syntax</li>
    <li>React event handlers are written inside curly braces</li></ul>
<h2>Event Handlers</h2>
<ul><li>A good practice is to put the event handler as a method in the component class:</li></ul>
<h2>Bind this</h2>
<ul><li>For methods in React, the this keyword should represent the component that owns the method.</li>
<li>That is why you should use arrow functions.  With arrow function, this will always represent the object that define the arrow function</li></ul>
<h2>Why Arrow Functions?</h2>
<ul><li>In class components, the this keyword is not defined by default, so with regular functions the this keyword represents the object that called the method, which can be the global window object, a HTML button, or whatever</li>
<li>If you must use regular functions instead of arrow functions you have to bind this to the component instance using the bind() methidcd </li></ul>
<h2>Passing Arguments</h2>
<ul><li>If you want to send parameters into an event handler you have two options:</li>
<ul><ol>Make and anonymous arrow function</ol>
<ol>Bind the event handler to this</ol>
<li>Note the first argument has to be this</li>
<li>If you send arguments without using the bind method, (this.shoot(this,"Goal") instead of this.shoot.bind(this,"Goal")), the shoot function will be executed when the page is loaded instead of waiting for the button to be clicked</li></ul></ul>
<h2>React Event Object</h2>
<ul><li>Event hanlders have access to the React event that triggered the function</li>
<li>With the arrow function you have to send the event argument manually</li>
<li>Without arrow function, the React event object is sent automatically as the last argument with the bind() methid</li></ul>
