<h1>React Events</h1>
<ul><li>Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events</li>
<li>React has the same events as HTML: Click, change, mouseover</li></ul>
<h2>Adding Events</h2>
<ul><li>React events are written in camelCase syntax</li>
    <li>React event handlers are written inside curly braces</li></ul>
<h2>Event Handlers</h2>
<ul><li>A good practice is to put the event handler as a method in the component class:</li></ul>
