<h1>ES6 Overview</h1>
<ul>
    <li>ES6 stands for ECMAScript6</li>
    <li>ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in
        2015
    </li>
    <li>React uses ES6, you should be familiar with some of the features like
        <ul>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Arrow Functions</li>
            <li>Variables</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A class is a type of function</li>
    <li>The properties of the class are assigned inside a constructor method</li>
    <li>The constructor function is called automatically when the object is initialised</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can create your own methods within the classes</li>
    <li>You call the method by referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside
        the parentheses)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Class Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To create a class inheritance, use the extends keywords</li>
    <li>A class created with class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class</li>
    <li>The super method refers to the parent class</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arrow functions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax</li>
</ul>

<h2>this</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The handling of this is also different in arrow function compared to regular functions</li>
    <li>The arrow functions have no binding to this</li>
    <li>In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window
        , the document, a button or whatever
    </li>
    <li>with arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function</li>
</ul>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Before ES6 there were only way of defining your variables: with the var keyword. If you did not define them,
        they would be assigned to the global object
    </li>
    <li>With ES6 there are 3 ways to define variables
        <dl>
            <dt>var</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you use var outside of a function it belongs in the global scope</li>
                    <li>If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function</li>
                    <li>If you use var inside of a block, i.e a for loop the variable is still available outside of that
                        block
                    </li>
                    <li>var has a function scope, not a block scope</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>let</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>let is the block scoped version of var and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is
                        defined
                    </li>
                    <li>If you use let inside of a block (i.e. a loop) the variable is only available inside of that
                        loop
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>const</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>const is a variable that once it has been created the value can never change</li>
                    <li>const has a block scope</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

        </dl>
    </li>
</ul>
