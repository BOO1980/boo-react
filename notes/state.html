<h1>State</h1>
<ul>
    <li>React components has a built-in state object</li>
    <li>The state object is where you store property values belongs to the component</li>
    <li>When the state object changes, the components re-renders</li>
    <li>The state object is initialised in the constructor</li>
    <li>The State object can contain as many properties as you like</li>
    <li>You can refer to the state object anywhere in the component by using the this.state.propertyName syntax</li>
    <li>To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method</li>
    <li>When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change to
        the new value(s)
    </li>
    <li>Always use the setState() method to change the state object, it will ensure that the component knows its been
        updated and calls the render() method (and all the other lifecycle methods).
    </li>
</ul>
