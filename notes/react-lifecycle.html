<h1>Lifecycle of Components</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its 3 three main phases</li>
    <li>The 3 phases are: mounting, updating adn unmounting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mounting</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mounting means putting elements into the DOM</li>
    <li>React has for built in methods that gets called, in this order when mounting a component
        <ul>
            <li>constructor()</li>
            <li>getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
            <li>render()</li>
            <li>componentDidMount()</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you
        define them
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Constructor</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The constructor method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and its the natural
        place to set up the initial state and other initial values
    </li>
    <li>The constructor method is called with the props, as arguments and you should always start by called the
        super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parents constructor method and allows the component to
        inherit methods from its parent (React.Component)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Get derived state from props</h3>
<ul>
    <li>getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.</li>
    <li>This is a natural place to set the state object based on the initial props</li>
    <li>
    <li>It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state</li>
</ul>
<h3>Render</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM</li>
</ul>
<h3>componentDidMount</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered</li>
    <li>This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM</li>
</ul>
<h3>Updating</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated</li>
    <li>A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props</li>
    <li>React has five built-in methods that gets called, in the order, when a component is updated:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
    <li>shouldComponentUpdate()</li>
    <li>render()</li>
    <li>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</li>
    <li>componentDidUpdate()</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you
        define them
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>getDerivedStateFromProps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is called when a
        component gets updated.
    </li>
    <li>This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props</li>
</ul>
<h3>shouldComponentUpdate</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should
        continue with the rendering or not
    </li>
    <li>The default value is true</li>
</ul>
<h3>render</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM,
        with the new changes
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you can access to the props and state before the update, meaning that
        even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update
    </li>
    <li>If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method,
        otherwise you will get an error
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>componentDidUpdate</h3>
<ul><li>The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM</li>
</li></ul>
<h3>componentWillUnmount</h3>
<ul><li>The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM</li>
</ul>
