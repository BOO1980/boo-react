    <li>In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM</li>
    <li>In React, form data is usually handled by the components</li>
    <li>When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state</li>
    <li>You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute</li>
